This project is a mobile app clone of the popular online game wordle. 
However, unlike wordle, the user can play more than one word a day by clicking the new game button.

The app is built using expo-cli. To run it, first execute the command "npm install -g expo-cli" in the terminal.
Once expo is installed, run the app with the command 'npm start' followed by the name of your app (in this case Wordle_Clone)
